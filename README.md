# ApplyHugoTheme

(I have hugo and git installed.)
[hugo install](https://gohugo.io/installation/)



```shell 
hugo new site hugo-thema 
```

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.    
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files    
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

```shell 
cd hugo-theme

```
